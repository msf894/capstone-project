    "One of the most legendary quotes in American Football belongs to coach Paul “Bear” Bryant who said \"Defense wins championships.\" In the wake of phenomenal offensive talents such as Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson, it's apparent that the league has shifted towards an offense-focused mindset. It's hard to argue with results, especially when they result in championships. Regardless, there is a reason why coaches and players spent hours upon hours reviewing film of their opponents. Film sessions are done to point out what type of plays offenses like to run and help better prepare the defense for your opponent. You might not be able to completely stop a player like Mahomes but if you can slow him down, you can put your team in a better position to win."

    "The purpose of this project was to analyze NFL offense tendencies and design a predictive model that could accurately predict whether a team is planning on passing or running the ball. By looking at play-by-play data from all NFL regular season games, I wanted to identify any trends in offense play-calling that have become prevalent in recent years. I also developed visualizations to help provide an in-depth look into which sides of the field an offense liked to attack when running or passing the ball. By learning a team's tendencies on offense, you can have your defense in a better situation to anticipate the play-call and make a stop or even force a turnover."

It contains various columns about each play, such as a description of the play, how many yards were gained on the play, and which players were involved. Supplemental information was taken from www.pro-football-reference.com and NFL Game Pass for video corroboration.

I decided to put it towards creating visualizations that could show how the league and individual teams have changed over the years. There are certain notions about how football has evolved over the years that I wanted to look at, such as a common thought that the NFL has become a “pass-heavy” league. The reality is that the pass-run ratio has barely changed in recent years."

    "One of the most crucial components of a play not featured within this dataset was the personnel used on the play. As an example, certain personnel sets (ones with more TEs as blockers) are better suited for run plays. In addition, knowing who is on the field can provide valuable insights for what kind of play to suspect. I'd also like to incorporate playoff situations into the model. Towards the end of the season, teams that are fighting for a playoff spot will be more aggressive as they cannot afford to lose crucial games. Teams in need of a win will do what it takes to ensure they are in contention during the game. I would also like to do a web deployment where you can access the visualizations of play-calling trends and pass/run locations for each NFL team."
